# Shared Appartment Calculator (SAC)

Small calculator to approximate the share of rent each tenant should pay, given the area of their room and the total rent of the appartment. 
It is also possible to add extra shared taxes like intenet or council tax to the calculation for budgeting purposes. 

The app is meant to be a first guess at what a fare share of rent would be. It doesn't take into account features like insuite bathrooms, balcony, etc.. 


## Examples: 

### Python app (discontinuated):

It is possible to input the total area of the appartment, and to assign the importance of the shared spaces in the division of rent. 

For example, some people might consider that the price per square meter of the shared space shuold be the same as the price per square meter of the rooms. While others don't value the shared space area. Or the shared space area maybe includes a big patio, so the value should be lower than that of the rooms.


#### Next updates: 
- Be able to input shared area, in case a house has many halls, so the shared area has less value. 
- Display how much of the rent also goes to taxes.
- Add a model to estimate the mean value per square meter in the surrounding postal code area.
