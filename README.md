# Shared Appartment Calculator (SAC)

Small calculator to approximate the share of rent each tenant should pay, given the area of their room and the total rent of the appartment. 
It is also possible to add extra shared taxes like intenet or council tax to the calculation for budgeting purposes. 

The app is meant to be a first guess at what a fare share of rent would be. It doesn't take into account features like insuite bathrooms, balcony, etc..
